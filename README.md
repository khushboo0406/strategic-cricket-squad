# Introduction

In this end-to-end data analytics project for beginners and advanced users, I have used cricket T20 world cup (2022) to build insights on a best 11 players team that we can assemble from all over the world. I used the data provided by codebasics which was scraped from espncricinfo website and then after collecting the data, I performed some data transformation and cleaning in pandas, followed by building dashboard in powerbi to perform analyses on T20 World cup cricket data.

# Conclusion ðŸ’¡

Final Best T20 11 Players for the team are as follows:

1. Jos Buttler
2. Rile Rossouw
3. Virat Kohli
4. Suryakumar Yadav
5. Glenn Phillips
6. Marcus Stoinis
7. Sikandar Raza
8. Shadab Khan
9. Sam Curran
10. Anrich Nortje
11. Shaheeh Shah Afridi

Jos Buttler and Rile Rossouw will be opening the game and at 3rd position we have Virat Kohli followed by SuryaKumar Yadav and Glenn Phillips. Since we want a sixth bowler who can bowl pace I am going for Marcus Stoinis. On the given day if the pitch is supporting spinners we can go with Glenn Maxwell instead of Marcus Stoinis. If any of the fast bowlers is injured then I will keep Hardik Pandya as an option.
